  # About

    title: "About Me"
    image: "/images/self.png"
    content: |-
      I’m an automotive test engineer with experience in designing and implementing automated test cases for automotive ECUs. My work involves reviewing, analyzing, and translating system requirements into structured and effective test procedures.

      I’ve worked extensively with CANoe software and have developed test cases using the CAPL language. Additionally, I use Python both professionally—to create tools and scripts supporting the testing pipeline—and privately for personal projects and home automation solutions.

      Outside of work, I’m passionate about self-hosting, open-source software, and smart home technologies. I manage most of my self-hosted infrastructure and services using OpenTofu and have built a variety of smart home end devices based on the ESPHome framework. I enjoy experimenting with home automation setups, integrating various open-source platforms, and building efficient, privacy-respecting systems tailored to my needs. I also have some experience with 3D CAD software such as Fusion 360 and Onshape, which I occasionally use to design custom enclosures and mechanical parts for my smart home devices.
